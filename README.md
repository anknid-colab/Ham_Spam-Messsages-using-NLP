# Spam-messagaes-using-NLP
In this project we are going to perform Natural Language Processing. We are going to use Bag Of Words Technique to predict ham and spam messagaes.
In the 21sy century, only 21 % data is available in structured format. Vast amount of data is in text format which is highly unstructured in nature. In order to get necessary information from this kind of data, text mining and Natural Language Processing is important. NLP is part of Artificial Intelligence which deals with human languages.

In the given Juoyter Notebook, I have explained steps to perform NLP using Bag of Words technique and I have predicted Ham and SPAM messages using Naive Bayes Algorithm.
The recall of the model is 99.5 %.
